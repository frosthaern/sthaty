## TODO
- load the dataset
- convert the dataset to list of strings
- tokenize, vectorize and extract attention heads for all of them
- and store it in a file and have the filename
- and you have to apply jensen_coeff for all of them and store it in a file and have the filename
- then you have to use the jensen heads and cluster, you can use something that uses cosine similarity
- then you have to calculate cluster head and calculate score for each cluster and heatmap for each cluster
- and visualize the activation heads for each cluster
